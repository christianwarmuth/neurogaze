## Abstract

Eyetracking has gained a lot of attention and also found a way into consumer products like modern laptops nowadays. The aim of this explorative research was to use an eyetracker and analyzing different behavioral patterns over longer periods of time for two participants without creating laboratory conditions. This setup was consciously chosen so that we could test the robustness of the assertions under real conditions.  Here, we analyzed the pupil diameter, the position on the screen as well as the position of the head relative to the display while recording which software applications the participants used and event data for the respective applications. 

We found that we tend to blink more as the day progresses by analyzing multiple working days of two participants performing various different tasks that over the course of a day. Furthermore, external influences like weather, lowering of roller shutters in the respective rooms or other factors are reflected very accurately in the data. Besides we tend to move further away from the screen over the course of the day.

When analyzing the working behavior which manifests in the eyetracking data, we found that there are clear interaction patterns between the different applications we use. For example, the use of a messenger service is clearly different from the use and interaction with pdf-readers, browsers or development environments for coding. In the course of the analysis, we could clearly distinguish between different activities (reading, coding, and scrolling etc.), whereas in a longer analysis we might have the opportunity to on the one hand distinguish between more activities and on the other hand analyze more subtleties within the different activities (including differentiating between different reading types), for which various research results already exist. 

Encouraged by previous research in this field, we have thought about an experimental framework to elaborate and analyze whether blinks, micro-saccades and pupil-diameter qualify for determining the cognitive load of users. This can either be used to develop user interfaces which only imposes little ground cognitive load to the user and which can be used to adapt the cognitive load to the situation of the user.   We came up with a research proposal taking into account blinks, micro-saccades and pupil-diameter in its individual role as well as in the interplay as an indicator for cognitive load via the n-back-task.
